# Airbnb Clone Collaboration Project
 Welcome to the Airbnb Clone console project!!.

## Introduction
This is a joint endeavor between Felicity Essien and Dennis Makaka aimed at developing a simplified version of the popular accommodation rental platform, Airbnb. The aim is to create a command-line Interface application that replicate some of the core functionalities of Airbnb, such as property listing, booking management, and user interaction among others.

## Project structure

 The project follows a structured file organization:

### airbnb-clone

        - *other modules*
 - console.py
 - file-storage.py
